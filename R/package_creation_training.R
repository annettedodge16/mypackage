#.Rproj.user, if you have it, is a directory used internally by RStudio.

#DESCRIPTION provides metadata about your package.
#NAMESPACE declares the functions your package exports for external use and the external functions your package imports from other packages.
#The R/ directory is the “business end” of your package. It will soon contain .R files with function definitions.

# format should avoid ‘"’, ‘*’, ‘:’, ‘/’, ‘<’, ‘>’, ‘?’, ‘\’, and ‘|’ , spaces, and  ‘con’, ‘prn’, ‘aux’, ‘clock$’, ‘nul’, ‘com1’ to ‘com9’, and ‘lpt1’ to ‘lpt9’

# 2-3 numbers

#We don't need to run the function, we will load it
#load_all() simulates the installation and loading of a package as if you opened it with library(mypackage)
#Note that any code that you don't want it to run again should be commented out
#Your functions will not appear in the global env but will be available to you to use just by calling them

##load_all()

# check that everything is in working order
#It's good to check after every new addition

##check()
#this also prompted me to install rtools

# Create Documentation for your new Function using roxygen
#Go into the .R file for your function and type #'
# Requirements:
# Title of function
# @param definition of parameters
# @return definition of the output
# @export will tag the function for exportation and get it into the namespace file. This allows the function to be available to the user after they load the package
# @examples lets you show examples of your function (not required)

#To create the .Rd file
##document()
##?testfx1
# Note that some links won't be built until after the package is formally built and installed such as the example - help

# Install the package into you library
## install()
## library(mypackage)

# Unit Test your functions #
# initialise testthat for unit testing
##use_testthat()
##use_test("testfx1") #This will open/create the test-function.R where you will write your test

## test_that("addition works", {
## expect_equal(testfx1(1,2), 3)
## })

# The above test will evaluate whether the output of the function is equal to the correct answer that you have supplied
# To run all your tests:
##test()
# your tests will also run when you do check()


# Using other packages in your package
# This will tell your package to put the dplyr package into your imports (ie your dependencies)

# The lifecycle of an R package: Package States
# Source
  # Directory of files in a defined structure.
# Bundled
  # a bundled package has been comparessed into a single file. Extension .tar and.gz
  # also known as "source tarballs
  # Single file = .tar. Comparessed by gzip = .gz
  # For transportation of packages
# Binary
  # package formats delivered by CRAN
  #.zip files
  #So users can use the package without having the rtools for package building
# Installed
  # install() or devtools::install_github() will change a package from
  # the source, bundled or binary states and install it on the computer
# in-memory
  # Library(package) will add an installed package to the memory, making it
  # available to direct use.

# Good to keep the top-level of the source code the working directory
# This will prevent problems with paths in different package states

# check()ing your package
  # Ensures all documentation is up to date
  # bundles package before checking it (gets rid of temp files)


# Navigating through your source files
  # Press Ctrl and . at the same time to open a file navigator that will open the file you type into it
  # Press Ctrl Shift F to search through all files for word

# Tidyverse Style Guide
  #Syntax:
    #object naming. lowercase letters, numbers of _. Sperate words with _. Don't use .
    # functions should be verbs, variables should be nouns
    # avoid reusing variable and function names and don't copy names from other common variables or functions
    # always put a space after a comma [1, 3] and never before [ , 3]bad [, 3]good
    # don't put spaces around parentheses for regular function calls function(x, y, z) NOT function ( x, y, z )
    # Place a space before and after () when used with if, for, or while : if (debug) {
    # Place a space after () used for function arguments: function(x) { }
    # { } should always have inner spaces
    # operators should be surrounded by spaces: == + - <-
    # NEVER SPACE: The operators with high precedence: ::, :::, $, @, [, [[, ^, unary -, unary +, and :.
